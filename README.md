PREDICTING 2024 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OUTCOMES USING POLLING DATA AND DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION ON AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA

Note: This is an ongoing, active project. Taking a cue from other popular polling aggregate outcome predictors, it is intended as a proof of concept to show the development and deployment of an XGBoost classification model using Amazon Code Editor (Visual Studio Code-OSS) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 buckets, EC2 instances, and SageMaker Studio Pipelines. Stay tuned.
